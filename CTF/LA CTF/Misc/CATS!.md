# CATS!

[Problem](https://github.com/uclaacm/lactf-archive/tree/master/2023/misc/cats)

Use the functionality of Chrome "Search by image"(the white frame should frame the whole picture); the first result is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_PCZcHPz6s). It has a link in the description, that's the flag.
